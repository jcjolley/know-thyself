# Guided Self-Reflection Journeys

Design document for user-selectable guided conversations that facilitate meaningful self-reflection while naturally gathering psychological profile data.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Primary Goal**: Create genuinely valuable self-reflection experiences
**Secondary Benefit**: Profile data emerges naturally from authentic exploration

Each journey should feel like a meaningful conversation with a wise friend or therapist, not a questionnaire. The user should finish feeling they've gained insight, not just answered questions.

## Journey Concepts

### Tier 1: Foundation Journeys
*These address fundamental questions most people benefit from exploring*

---

#### Journey: "What Do You Actually Need?"
**Theme**: Understanding your current needs and what's truly weighing on you
**Axes**: Maslow Status (primary), Life Situation (secondary)
**Compelling Hook**: "Sometimes we're so busy managing life that we forget to check in with ourselves. Let's slow down and really look at where you are."

**Arc**:
1. Opening: Gentle check-in on life basics (not interrogation)
2. Deepening: Explore what's taking mental energy
3. Uncovering: Find the need beneath the surface concern
4. Insight: Connect patterns, name the actual need
5. Grounding: What would it mean to address this need?

**Why standalone**: Maslow is foundational to everything. Getting this wrong means all other advice is misguided. Deserves dedicated attention.

---

#### Journey: "What Matters Most to You?"
**Theme**: Discovering and articulating your core values
**Axes**: Core Values (primary), Moral Foundations (secondary)
**Compelling Hook**: "We all have values, but few of us have really examined what they are. Let's find out what you'd never compromise on."

**Arc**:
1. Opening: When have you felt most yourself?
2. Trade-offs: Exploring difficult choices you've made
3. Tensions: Where do your values conflict?
4. Hierarchy: What wins when values compete?
5. Integration: How do these values show up in your life?

**Why combined**: Values and moral foundations are deeply intertwined. Exploring "what matters" naturally reveals both.

---

#### Journey: "Where Are You Going?"
**Theme**: Clarifying goals, dreams, and direction
**Axes**: Goals (primary), Current Challenges (secondary), Immediate Intent (tertiary)
**Compelling Hook**: "Between where you are and where you want to be lies a path. Let's map it together."

**Arc**:
1. Opening: What's been on your mind lately?
2. Desires: If things went well, what would be different?
3. Obstacles: What's in the way?
4. Deeper: Is that the real obstacle, or is something beneath it?
5. Clarity: What's one thing that would make a difference?

**Why combined**: Goals, challenges, and intent are three faces of the same thing - where you're trying to go and what's stopping you.

---

### Tier 2: Personality & Pattern Journeys
*These help people understand their own tendencies and patterns*

---

#### Journey: "How You Show Up"
**Theme**: Understanding your personality and natural tendencies
**Axes**: Big Five (comprehensive)
**Compelling Hook**: "There's no right way to be. But knowing your natural tendencies helps you work with yourself, not against yourself."

**Arc**:
1. Energy: How do you recharge? (Extraversion)
2. Approach: How do you tackle problems? (Openness, Conscientiousness)
3. Connection: How do you relate to others? (Agreeableness)
4. Pressure: How do you handle stress? (Neuroticism)
5. Integration: Seeing the whole picture of how you operate

**Why standalone**: Big Five is comprehensive and self-contained. Mixing with other axes would dilute it.

---

#### Journey: "Your Relationship with Risk"
**Theme**: Understanding how you navigate uncertainty and make decisions
**Axes**: Risk Tolerance (primary), Motivation Style (secondary)
**Compelling Hook**: "Some people leap, some people look. Neither is wrong. But knowing which you are changes everything about how you should approach decisions."

**Arc**:
1. Reflection: Think of a big decision you made - how did you approach it?
2. Feeling: What does uncertainty feel like to you?
3. Motivation: Are you running toward something or away from something?
4. Patterns: Do you see this pattern elsewhere in your life?
5. Application: How might this self-knowledge change how you approach your current situation?

**Why combined**: Risk tolerance and motivation style are both about how you face the unknown. Natural pairing.

---

#### Journey: "How You Connect"
**Theme**: Understanding your patterns in close relationships
**Axes**: Attachment Style (primary), Support-Seeking Style (secondary)
**Compelling Hook**: "The way we learned to connect early on shapes how we connect now. Understanding this pattern is the first step to choosing something different."

**Arc**:
1. Opening: Tell me about your closest relationships
2. Patterns: What tends to happen when relationships get close?
3. Needs: What do you need from people, and what's hard to ask for?
4. Support: When you're struggling, what helps? What doesn't?
5. Insight: What would it mean to get what you need?

**Why combined**: Attachment and support-seeking are both about how we relate to others when vulnerable.

---

### Tier 3: Deeper Exploration Journeys
*These address more nuanced aspects of self-understanding*

---

#### Journey: "Who's in Control?"
**Theme**: Exploring your sense of agency and relationship with change
**Axes**: Locus of Control (primary), Growth Mindset (secondary), Self-Efficacy (tertiary)
**Compelling Hook**: "Do you believe you can change your life? Your answer to this question shapes everything."

**Arc**:
1. Attribution: When things go well or badly, what's the cause?
2. Agency: What do you feel you can actually control?
3. Change: Do you believe you can become different?
4. Efficacy: Do you trust yourself to handle what comes?
5. Reclaiming: Where might you have more power than you think?

**Why combined**: These three axes are all about personal agency and belief in one's ability to affect outcomes.

---

#### Journey: "Living in Time"
**Theme**: Understanding your relationship with past, present, and future
**Axes**: Temporal Orientation (primary)
**Compelling Hook**: "Some of us live in memories, some in dreams of the future, some in the moment. Where do you spend most of your time?"

**Arc**:
1. Awareness: Where does your mind go when you're not focused?
2. Past: What's your relationship with your history?
3. Present: How good are you at being here now?
4. Future: How much do you plan, worry, or dream ahead?
5. Balance: What might it look like to be more present where you want to be?

**Why standalone**: Temporal orientation is a unique dimension that deserves focused exploration.

---

#### Journey: "Under Pressure"
**Theme**: Understanding how you respond to stress and difficulty
**Axes**: Stress Response (primary), Emotional Regulation (secondary)
**Compelling Hook**: "When the heat is on, what do you do? Fight, flee, freeze, or please? Knowing your pattern is power."

**Arc**:
1. Recognition: Think of the last time you were really stressed
2. Body: What happened in your body?
3. Behavior: What did you do?
4. Patterns: Is this typical for you?
5. Evolution: What would you like to do differently next time?

**Why combined**: Stress response and emotional regulation are both about handling difficult moments.

---

#### Journey: "Ready for Change"
**Theme**: Assessing readiness and exploring ambivalence about change
**Axes**: Change Readiness (primary)
**Compelling Hook**: "Change is possible, but timing matters. Let's explore where you really are with the changes you're considering."

**Arc**:
1. Desire: What would you like to be different?
2. Ambivalence: What's the case for staying the same?
3. Readiness: How ready do you feel, really?
4. Capacity: What would you need to be more ready?
5. Commitment: What's one small step that would signal commitment?

**Why standalone**: Change readiness is meta - it's about readiness to act on all the other insights.

## Next Steps

2. **Develop journey scripts**: Full conversational flow for each
3. **Create system prompts**: How Claude should conduct each journey
4. **Build extraction logic**: How to capture insights from each journey
5. **Design UI**: How users select and experience journeys

---

## Open Questions

1. Should journeys be locked/unlocked based on profile completeness?
2. Can users re-take journeys? How do we handle changed answers?
3. How long should each journey take? (10 min? 30 min? Variable?)
4. Should there be a "recommended next journey" based on gaps?
